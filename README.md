This is the final project of course IBM Data science from Coursera.
In this project, we will collect data from rocket launches from SpaceX.
We will analyze data from launches with Falcon 9 boosters and explore it to find best conditions that improve the chance of successfully landing of the boosters.
We will create machine learning models to predict if the booster will make the landing.
